Protection concerns remain high, especially for women and girls. People affected by violence have limited access to formal justice as well as restriction in their movement and access to basic needs such as food. The humanitarian community in South Sudan estimates that 9.4 million people need humanitarian assistance in 2023, a staggering 76 %of South Sudan's population, increased by 500 000 people from 2022. Regarding the impact of the ongoing conflict in the neighboring Sudan, over 149 000 individuals have been recorded arriving in South Sudan since the conflict erupted on 15 April and the number of arrivals is projected to increase as the crisis continues. Onward transportation of South Sudanese returnees and Sudanese refugees from transit sites remains a significant challenge due to the combination of poor road infrastructure and large distances, insecurity in some areas and the additional logistical challenges posed by the onset of the rainy season"
